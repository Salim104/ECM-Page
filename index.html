            <h1>“my story”</h1>
            <p>
              Most of my upbringing was an intense roller coaster of emotions.
              From drowning with thoughts of anxiety, self-doubt, and consistent
              profound ideas of just ending it all, I often felt I had sunken
              deep in the ocean of pain and worthlessnessm, I can still remember
              vividly at age 14 when I had been contemplating for months to take
              my life.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="myStory-text">
          <p>
            I cried myself to sleep almost every-single-day, waking up the next
            day with the most innocent gratitude that I had made it to the next
            day, while in contrast, deep down, I knew I just wanted to end it
            all. I had had enough, enough of crying, enough of hoping and
            longing that my life should have turned out differently.
          </p>

          <p>
            This constant and fervent feeling that my life was harder than that
            of anyone else, laid so heavy on my shoulders that enjoying life was
            almost impossible. And living in a society in which avoiding pain or
            suffering in silence is seen as a sign of strength, sharing this
            with anyone else was not ideal. My strongest desire was to
            experience a community that did not only see me but heard me, a
            community that assured me that I was not alone and that I too had a
            story that mattered. After countless efforts of trying to explain
            who I am or why I thought the way I did, I felt more alone and
            eventually had to shrink my truest self to fit in in a place that
            was never meant for me anyway.
          </p>

          <p>
            For that reason, every conversation matters was born. I felt the
            urge so profound to start an organisation (ECM) that allows for a
            safe space for people to voice out, speak their thoughts openly and
            encounter their power through their own story. Because just like
            myself, people are longing for a community that not only sees them
            but hears them, a community that assures them that they too are not
            alone. And Every Conversation Matters advocates for exactly that.
